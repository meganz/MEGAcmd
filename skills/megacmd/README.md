## Account Requirements

### MEGA Account

- A [MEGA.nz](https://mega.nz) account is required for most operations
- Downloading public links does not require login
- Uploading to public folders (File Requests) does not require login
- A **Pro** plan is required for:
  - Password-protected links (`export --password`)
  - Expiring links (`export --expire`)
  - Higher storage and transfer limits

### Required Credentials

| Operation | Requires | How to get |
|---|---|---|
| Login | Email + password | Create at mega.nz |
| 2FA | `--auth-code` | Enable 2FA in account settings |
| Password-protected link | Link password | Set when exporting |
| Writable link | `--auth-key` | Generated when exporting with `--writable` |

### Master Key (Recovery Key)

**Essential.** Without the Master Key, losing your password means losing **all your data**. It must be saved immediately after creating your account:

```bash
mega-masterkey ./my-recovery-key.txt
```

## Installing MEGAcmd

### Via Official Package (Recommended)

Download the installer for your system at: [https://mega.nz/cmd](https://mega.nz/cmd)

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Add repository
wget -O /tmp/megacmd.deb https://mega.nz/linux/repo/xUbuntu_24.04/amd64/megacmd_2.5.2-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/megacmd.deb
sudo apt install -f
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Download DMG from https://mega.nz/cmd and drag to Applications
export PATH=/Applications/MEGAcmd.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Download and run installer from https://mega.nz/cmd
# Silent installation:
MEGAcmdSetup.exe /S

# Add to PATH:
$env:PATH += ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\MEGAcmd"
```

### Via Manual Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd.git
cd MEGAcmd && git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -B build/build-cmake-Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/build-cmake-Release -j$(nproc)
sudo cmake --install build/build-cmake-Release
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
which mega-exec        # Should show the binary path
mega-exec version      # Should show the version
mega-help              # Should list commands
```

## How to Use This Skill

### Activation

The skill is **automatically** activated by the agent when the conversation context matches the `description`. To force activation, mention "MEGAcmd", "MEGA.nz", "sync with MEGA", "upload to MEGA", or similar.

```

### Agent Fallback

If the agent cannot find the skill, it can use:
- `AGENTS.md` (English) or `AGENTS.pt-BR.md` (Portuguese) at the project root
- `mega-command --help` for each command's help
- `mega-help` for a complete command list

---

## Interaction Modes

### Scriptable (recommended for agents)

Commands with the `mega-` prefix executed directly in the terminal:

```bash
mega-login user@email.com password
mega-put ~/document.pdf /Documents/
mega-get /remote/file.pdf ~/Downloads/
```

### Interactive (MEGAcmd shell)

Commands without prefix inside the shell:

```bash
mega-cmd
MEGA CMD> login user@email.com
MEGA CMD> ls /
MEGA CMD> get file.pdf
```

> ⚠️ Agents in a bash terminal should **always** use the `mega-` prefix.

## Quick Examples

```bash
# Login
mega-login me@email.com my-password

# Upload
mega-put ~/photo.jpg /Images/

# Download
mega-get /Documents/report.pdf ~/Downloads/

# Bidirectional sync
mega-sync ~/Documents /CloudDocs

# Public link
mega-export -a /Shared/Folder

# Daily backup
mega-backup ~/Photos /Backups --period="0 0 4 * * *" --num-backups=10

# WebDAV
mega-webdav /Videos --public --port=8080

# Check status
mega-whoami -l
mega-df -h
mega-sync
```
