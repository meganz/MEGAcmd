### https
Shows if HTTPS is used for transfers. Use "https on" to enable it.

Usage: `https [on|off]`
<pre>
HTTPS is not necesary since all data is stored and transfered encrypted.
Enabling it will increase CPU usage and add network overhead.

Notice that this setting will be saved for the next time you open MEGAcmd, but will be removed if you logout.
